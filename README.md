# Conite
Conite was a school project I completed during the first semester of my second year at Ã‰cole des Ponts ParisTech in 2021-2022. 
The course, TDLog, included web development and coding best practices. It ended with a two-month project where students had to create an application or a website.

Conite is the name I gave to my application. It aimed to create an online platform for clocking in and out workers.
